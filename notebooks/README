LIST OF NOTEBOOK FUNCTIONS:

check_diff.ipynb
    #Checks differences between the mag_500 magnitude we created to use with PhoSim and g-band magnitudes.
CreateSynthLightCurvesFromKasen2017.ipynb (Probably you should use magnitude.ipynb)
	#This notebook is modified from Douglas Tucker's notebook. It outputs SED files into the 'kasen/temp/' directory.
CreateSynthLightCurvesFromKasen2017_ORIGINAL.ipynb (Probably you should use magnitude.ipynb)
	#This notebook is Douglas Tucker's original notebook that creates Kasen SEDs and source magnitudes
Combine_throughputs.ipynb
	#This notebook reads in throughput files from LSST database and produces a single throughput file to be read by CreateSynthLightCurvesFromKasen2017.ipynb.
examine_instance.ipynb
	#This notebook reads in lists of data from the Run 1.2p instance catalogs and plots things like MJD.
join_kasen.ipynb
	#This notebook joins the red and blue Kasen models and plots them. This is how we reproduced the Kasen paper plot. 
kasen_plots.ipynb
    #Simple notebook that plots the variable parameters in the Kasen models.
lightcurve_all.ipynb
    #Plots lightcurves for all 329 Kasen models.
magnitude.ipynb
	#This is a copy of CreateSynthLightCurves... that includes the bandpass file for K-band. Use this to calculate magnitudes using various Kasen models.
make_instance.ipynb
	#This notebook generates instance files for a kilonova. These can be run to make all instance files for PhoSim.
MJD_to_Date.ipynb
    #Amna's program to convert MJD to calendar date.
phosim_run.ipynb
	#This notebook takes output FITS images from PhoSim runs and displays them.
plot_dp0.ipynb
    #Plots a csv file showing a particular MJD
plotter.ipynb
	#This reads in magnitude data for a kilonova and plots light curves, both individual and 6-band.
plotter_2.ipynb
	#Same as for plotter, but it plots light curves for simulated Kasen model magnitudes. It also plots the real GW170817 magnitudes.
plotter_3.ipynb
    #A notebook to plot light curves in one filter or several together.
plotter_kasen_SED.ipynb
    #Makes plots of SED files produced by the magnitude program. 
plotter_kasen-single.ipynb
	#This plots a single SED
plotter_IRTF.ipynb
	#Used to create Kband light curve graphs days after collision
read_instance.ipynb
	#This is designed to read object catalogs used as PhoSim instance files and to plot the positions of these objects. 
read_mags.ipynb
    #Reads in magnitudes at a particular time. 
SED_MAKER.ipynb
    #A version of the magnitude program that is designed to make SEDs.
test_kasen.ipynb
	#This notebook runs the code that came with the Kasen models.
