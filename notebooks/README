LIST OF NOTEBOOK FUNCTIONS:

CreateSynthLightCurvesFromKasen2017.ipynb
	#This notebook is modified from Douglas Tucker's notebook. It outputs SED files using his original flux units into the 'kasen/temp/' directory
CreateSynthLightCurvesFromKasen2017_ORIGINAL.ipynb
	#This notebook is Douglas Tucker's original notebook that creates Kasen SEDs and source magnitudes
make_instance.ipynb
	#This notebook generates instance files for a kilonova. These can be run to make all instance files for PhoSim.
phosim_run.ipynb
	#This notebook takes output FITS images from PhoSim runs and displays them.
plotter.ipynb
	#This reads in magnitude data for a kilonova and plots light curves, both individual and 6-band.
plotter_kasen-single.ipynb
	#This plots a single SED
plotter_kasen.ipynb
	#This works with 'CreateSynthLightCurvesFromKasen2017.ipynb.' It reads in the temp files and converts units to PhoSim units and prints SED files in kasen/SEDs. 
read_instance.ipynb
	#This is designed to read object catalogs used as PhoSim instance files and to plot the positions of these objects.
