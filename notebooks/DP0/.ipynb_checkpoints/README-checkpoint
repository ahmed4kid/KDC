LIST OF DP0 NOTEBOOK FUNCTIONS:

## Note that the DP0 notebooks are designed to run on data.lsst.cloud, the Rubin Science Platform. They will call the Butler and the LSST Stack and 
##thus will not run on a regular laptop.

NOTEBOOKS:


all_objects.ipynb
    #Runs an ADQL query to get all objects within 1 square degree of a point. This is different from square_degree.ipynb in that the latter
    #breaks the query into 4 pieces. 
cone_search.ipynb
    #Simple notebook that that just does a cone search around a point.
galaxy_viewer.ipynb
    #Includes functions to view a single calexp, multiple calexps, a coadd from ra and dec and coadd cutouts. Can also overplot green circles to show 
    #locations of input objects.
list_MJD.ipynb
    #Makes a list of MJDs for all exposures taken at a particular position.
mosaic.ipynb
    #This notebook reads in a list of images using the Butler for a single visit and displays them as a mosaic.
panstarrs.ipynb
    #This notebook reads in truth_DP0_phosim_real.csv and makes plots of both the DP0 galaxies hosting the KN and the original real galaxies.
single_image.ipynb
    #This reads RA and DEC and fetches a coadd image.
square_degree.ipynb
    #This notebooks produces images for 25 fields, assembling a full square_degree. 
square_search.ipynb
    #This does a TAP query to find objects within a 1 square degree box. It does it in 4 individual pieces so it doesn't crash.
synthetic_source.ipynb
    #This notebook does synthetic source injection of a series of point sources, then produces a catalog including the new objects. Finally it shows both real and fake sources together in an image. 
    
OTHER FILES:

input/SGRB_hosts_table.csv
    #The original list of PAN-Starrs objects sent from the UIUC group.
input/truth_DP0_phosim_real.csv
    #The matched list of DP0 objects and PAN-Starrs galaxies matched in TopCat in 2022.
